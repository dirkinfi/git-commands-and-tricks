Setting Up Your Workspace On Mac

Downloading necessary files
Save this file in your home directory with the name git-completion.bash: 
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
Save this file in your home directory with the name git-prompt.sh: 
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh
Download bash_profile_course: 
     https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/3341718587/supplemental_media/bash-profile-course/download?_ga=1.37232743.672083044.1467344711

If you already have a file in your home directory named .bash_profile, copy the content from bash_profile_course and paste it at the bottom of .bash_profile. Otherwise, move bash_profile_course to your home directory and rename it to .bash_profile. 

Make sure you can start your editor from the terminal
If you use Sublime, you can do this by add the following line to your .bash_profile (you may need to change the path if Sublime is installed in a different location for you):

alias subl="/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl"

Making Git configurations
Run the following Git configuration commands. The first one will need to be modified if you are using a text editor other than Sublime, or if Sublime is installed in another location for you. See this page for the correct command for a couple of other popular text editors. For any other editor, you'll need to enter the command you use to launch that editor from the terminal.

git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

Restart the terminal
You'll need to close and re-open the terminal before all your changes take effect.
